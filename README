Design principles:
 - Track the latest stable Bcfg2 version
 - Support only Ubuntu LTS releases starting with 14.04
 - Configuration only. binaries, scripts, plugins, ... should be shipped as
   their own packages
 - Minimal changes to the target system should always be the #1 goal
 - No config duplication, use templating instead
 - Make as much of the configuration files configurable through etc/

Coding guidelines:
 - Only use Genshi for templating
 - Whenever possible, lines shouldn't be longer than 79 characters
 - 4 spaces indent is to be preferred to tab indent
 - Comments are to be written in proper English
 - Commits have to identify the bundle being affected as in
   "<bundle>: commit message" with two special names:
     + "git" for changes to .gitignore
     + "bcfg2" for changes affecting the repository as a whole
 - Trailing white spaces are to be avoided
 - Scripts under utils/ should be executable python scripts
 - All python code needs to be 2.7/3.2 compatible
